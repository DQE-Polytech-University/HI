## Briefly about us
Our project focuses on quantum cryptography. We created a library for  prototyping quantum key distribution protocols. Using known protocols such as BB84 and Sarg04 and programming language Python we have made a quantum key distribution algorithm, encrypt the key itself, tried to restore it with the host as an example

## Our purpose
To create a tool for prototyping protocols of quantum key distribution. It is useful for the study and debugging of quantum protocols.
